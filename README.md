# Dijkstra-s-Shortest-Path-Algorithm
Implementation of Dijkstraâ€™s shortest path algorithm on a given Navy ship passageway network. Given a source node the algorithm finds the shortest path distance to each exit and which exit is the closest. The algorithm was implemented using the C++ programming language. The given passageway network is comprised of 23 nodes, and 28 edges which were weighted.
